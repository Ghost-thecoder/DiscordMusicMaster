# Discord Music Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord music bot built with Python that supports playing music from YouTube and Spotify. The bot uses discord.py for Discord integration, yt-dlp for YouTube audio extraction, and spotipy for Spotify integration. It features a modular architecture with separate components for music playback, queue management, and Spotify handling.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, object-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Event-driven Discord bot**: Built on discord.py with command-based interactions
- **Asynchronous processing**: Leverages Python's asyncio for non-blocking operations
- **Component-based design**: Separate modules for different functionalities
- **Stateful management**: Per-guild state management for music queues and players

## Key Components

### 1. Main Bot Controller (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Central bot orchestration and command handling
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with Discord.py commands framework
- **Key Features**: 
  - Bot initialization and configuration
  - Global manager instances for guilds
  - Event handling for bot lifecycle

### 2. Music Player (`music_player.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles audio playback and voice channel management
- **Architecture**: Class-based with yt-dlp integration
- **Key Features**:
  - Voice channel connection/disconnection
  - Audio stream processing with FFmpeg
  - YouTube audio extraction via yt-dlp

### 3. Queue Manager (`queue_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages music queue and playback history
- **Architecture**: Deque-based queue with history tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - FIFO queue implementation
  - Song history (last 10 tracks)
  - Queue manipulation methods

### 4. Spotify Handler (`spotify_handler.py`)
- **Purpose**: Processes Spotify URLs and extracts track information
- **Architecture**: Spotipy client wrapper with URL parsing
- **Key Features**:
  - Spotify API integration
  - Support for tracks, playlists, and albums
  - URL validation and ID extraction

### 5. Utilities (`utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Shared utility functions
- **Architecture**: Functional helpers for common operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Discord embed creation
  - URL validation and parsing
  - Video ID extraction

## Data Flow

1. **Command Reception**: User sends command to Discord bot
2. **URL Processing**: System determines if input is YouTube, Spotify, or search query
3. **Content Resolution**: 
   - YouTube: Direct yt-dlp processing
   - Spotify: API call to get track info, then search on YouTube
4. **Queue Management**: Songs added to guild-specific queue
5. **Playback**: Music player processes queue and streams audio
6. **State Management**: Current song and queue state maintained per guild

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **discord.py (>=2.5.2)**: Discord API wrapper for bot functionality
- **yt-dlp (>=2025.6.25)**: YouTube audio extraction and processing
- **spotipy (>=2.25.1)**: Spotify Web API client

### System Dependencies
- **FFmpeg**: Audio processing and streaming (required by discord.py)
- **Python 3.11+**: Runtime environment

### External Services
- **Discord API**: Bot authentication and guild management
- **Spotify Web API**: Track metadata and playlist information
- **YouTube**: Audio content source

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Nix-based environment**: Uses stable-24_05 channel for reproducible builds
- **Python 3.11 module**: Specified in .replit configuration
- **UV package management**: Modern Python dependency resolver

### Required Environment Variables
```
DISCORD_TOKEN: Bot authentication token
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: Spotify API client identifier
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: Spotify API client secret
```

### Deployment Process
1. Install dependencies via pip
2. Set environment variables
3. Run main.py to start bot
4. Bot automatically connects to Discord and registers commands

### Scalability Considerations
- Per-guild state isolation prevents cross-server interference
- Memory-efficient queue management with history limits
- Automatic cleanup on guild removal
